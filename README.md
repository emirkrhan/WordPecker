# WordPecker Mobile Challenge

## About

This is a challenge project for a 10-person team to develop a mobile version of the WordPecker language learning app using React Native with Expo. The project is based on the original web version of WordPecker, which helps users learn new vocabulary in context.

## Project Overview

WordPecker Mobile is a personalized language-learning app that brings the magic of Duolingo-style lessons to your own curated vocabulary lists and contexts. This app allows users to:

1. Create word lists from content they're consuming (books, articles, etc.)
2. Learn these words through interactive exercises 
3. Test knowledge with quizzes
4. Track progress and build vocabulary effectively

## Challenge Description

This repository contains a starter project with placeholder screens for 10 core features and 2 additional innovative features to be decided by the team. Your challenge is to implement these features within 2 weeks.

### Core Features:

1. **User Authentication** - Login/Registration system
2. **Word Lists** - View all your vocabulary lists
3. **Create List** - Add a new vocabulary list
4. **Add Words** - Add words to existing lists
5. **Learning Mode** - Practice exercises with your words
6. **Quiz Mode** - Test your knowledge of learned words
7. **List Details** - View and manage list content
8. **Progress Tracking** - Monitor your learning status
9. **Search** - Find words and lists
10. **Settings** - Manage app preferences

### Innovative Features:

The team is expected to create 2 additional innovative features that leverage mobile capabilities to enhance the language learning experience.

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository
2. Install dependencies with `npm install` or `yarn install`
3. Start the app with `npm start` or `yarn start`
4. Use Expo Go on your mobile device to test the app by scanning the QR code
5. Explore the placeholder screens for features to be implemented

## Development Guidelines

- Each team member should take ownership of at least one feature
- The authentication system should be built from scratch
- Code should be well-documented and follow best practices
- Features should be implemented with a consistent UI/UX approach
- Regular code reviews and team meetings are encouraged

# Welcome to your Expo app ðŸ‘‹

This is an [Expo](https://expo.dev) project created with [`create-expo-app`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/create-expo-app).

## Get started

1. Install dependencies

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. Start the app

   ```bash
    npx expo start
   ```

In the output, you'll find options to open the app in a

- [development build](https://docs.expo.dev/develop/development-builds/introduction/)
- [Android emulator](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/android-studio-emulator/)
- [iOS simulator](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/ios-simulator/)
- [Expo Go](https://expo.dev/go), a limited sandbox for trying out app development with Expo

You can start developing by editing the files inside the **app** directory. This project uses [file-based routing](https://docs.expo.dev/router/introduction).

## Get a fresh project

When you're ready, run:

```bash
npm run reset-project
```

This command will move the starter code to the **app-example** directory and create a blank **app** directory where you can start developing.
